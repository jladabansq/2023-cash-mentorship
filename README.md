# 2023 Cash Mentorship

**Mentor**

I was matched with my mentor Colin Marsch: [cmarsch@](https://my.sqprod.co/profile/cmarsch)

 <br/>
 
**Mentorship Goal**

My ultimate goal for this mentorship was to develop an iOS app. Initially, I planned to create a 50/30/20 budget app, but then changed it to a quiz app instead due to the complexity of my initial idea.

**Learning Path and Resources**

I decided to use [this](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/get-started-with-ios-app-development?u=2094516 ) learning path as a guide to learn iOS development. I did a little bit of modification because some of the courses in this learning path are outdated. Below are the list of courses I took:

- [Swift 5 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/swift-5-essential-training?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5a149a5d498eaa2ec62c8fce&u=2094516)
